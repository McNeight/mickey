Mickey is (c) 2003 - Matthias Melcher, Venice, CA 90291
Mickey is licensed under GPL.

In order to compile mickey, you will need to download and install
the user interface library 'FLTK1.1.x' or 'FLTK1.2.x' from 
www.fltk.org . 

There is no makefile included yet in this project. The easiest
way to compile mickey is to move the files into the test directory
of FLTK and add a line or two the fltk/test/makefile. Mickey
should compile without changes on all platforms that are supported
by FLTK, including Mac OS X, Windows 98/NT/2000/XP, and Linux.

Mickey does not support editing of very large files yet! See the
first two pages of hexEdit.cxx for more information on implemented
and planned features.

Have fun, send suggestions, 

 Matthias
